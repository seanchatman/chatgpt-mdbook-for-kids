# Markdown

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a special way of writing things that makes it easier to read and understand. It uses symbols to create headings, lists, and more. 
## Headers

Headers help you create titles and subtitles. To create a header, use the `#` symbol followed by a space and your text.
For different levels of headers, add more `#` symbols:

- `# Header 1`
- `## Header 2`
- `### Header 3`

Example:

```markdown
# My Pokemon Collection

## My Favorite Pokemon

### The Best Pokemon is Pikachu
```

## Lists

Lists are a great way to organize your text. There are two types of lists: ordered and unordered.

### Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, use the `-` symbol followed by a space and your text:

```markdown
- Pikachu
- Charmander
- Squirtle
```

### Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, use the `1.` symbol followed by a space and your text:

```markdown
1. Pikachu
2. Charmander
3. Squirtle
```

## Links

To create a [Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon) link, use the `[text](url)` syntax:

```markdown
[Pokedex](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex)
```

## Tables

To create a table, use the `|` symbol to separate the columns:

```markdown
| Pokemon | Type |
|---------|------|
| Pikachu | Electric |
| Charmander | Fire |
| Squirtle | Water |
```

| Pokemon    | Type     |
|------------|----------|
| Pikachu    | Electric |
| Charmander | Fire     |
| Squirtle   | Water    |
